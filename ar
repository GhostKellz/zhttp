### zhttp - HTTP Client/Server Library
- **Status**: ⚠️ Alpha/MVP
- **Repository**: https://github.com/ghostkellz/zhttp
- **Wraith Use**: **CRITICAL** - HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 client/server (bread and butter)

#### What Wraith Needs:
1. **HTTP/1.1 Server** - Request parsing, response generation
2. **HTTP/1.1 Client** - Upstream connections, connection pooling
3. **HTTP/2 Server** - Multiplexing, frame handling, ALPN
4. **HTTP/2 Client** - Upstream HTTP/2 support
5. **TLS Integration** - Works seamlessly with zcrypto
6. **Header Manipulation** - Add/remove/modify headers
7. **Chunked Transfer Encoding** - Proper streaming support
8. **Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling** - Efficient connection reuse
9. **Timeout Handling** - Configurable timeouts for all operations
10. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error types and recovery

#### Stabilization Checklist:
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite (HTTP/1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
- [ ] Property-based testing with ghostspec
- [ ] Fuzz testing for security (malformed requests/responses)
- [ ] Benchmark suite (compare with nginx, h2o)
- [ ] Memory leak detection (valgrind, sanitizers)
- [ ] Zero-copy optimizations where possible
- [ ] Documentation (API docs, examples, tutorials)
- [ ] Edge case handling (oversized headers, malformed requests)
- [ ] HTTP compliance testing (h2spec for HTTP/2)
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Connection pooling with health checks
- [ ] Graceful degradation (HTTP/2 → HTTP/1.1 fallback)

#### Current Gaps (Estimated):
- HTTP/2 multiplexing may have edge cases
- Connection pooling needs stress testing
- Error recovery needs hardening
- Need comprehensive RFC compliance testing
